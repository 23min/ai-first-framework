# AI-Assisted Development Framework

Portable, self-contained AI agent and skill system for structured software development.

7 role-based agents, 15+ workflow skills, multi-target sync (GitHub Copilot + Claude Code).

## Prerequisites

- **git** — for subtree integration
- **[GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)** — required for issue tracking and contributing. AI agents use `gh` to create, update, and close issues. Install via your package manager or add to your devcontainer:
  ```json
  {
    "features": {
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {}
    }
  }
  ```

## Installation

### Add to your project via git subtree

```bash
git remote add ai-framework git@github.com:23min/ai-first-framework.git
git subtree add --prefix=.ai ai-framework main --squash
```

### First-time setup

```bash
bash .ai/scripts/init-project.sh   # creates work/ dirs, ROADMAP.md, PROJECT_PATHS.md
bash .ai/scripts/sync-all.sh       # syncs to .claude/ and .github/
```

### Pulling updates

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=.ai ai-framework main --squash
bash .ai/scripts/sync-all.sh
```

### Pushing improvements back

```bash
git subtree push --prefix=.ai ai-framework feature/my-improvement
# Then open a PR on the framework repo
```

### Devcontainer integration

Add to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to keep targets synced on rebuild:

```json
{
  "postCreateCommand": "bash .ai/scripts/sync-all.sh"
}
```

## Structure

### 📁 agents/
Role-based personas that define focus areas and responsibilities:
- **architect** - Design decisions, system boundaries, epic planning
- **implementer** - Coding with minimal risk, following TDD
- **tester** - Test planning, TDD workflow, regression safety
- **documenter** - Documentation quality, release notes
- **deployer** - Infrastructure, packaging, releases
- **maintainer** - AI framework evolution (agents/skills), repository infrastructure

### 📁 skills/
Reusable workflows for common development tasks:
- **Epic lifecycle**: epic-refine → epic-start → epic-wrap
- **Milestone lifecycle**: milestone-draft → milestone-start → milestone-wrap
- **Development**: red-green-refactor, code-review
- **Infrastructure**: branching, deployment, release
- **Planning**: roadmap, gap-triage
- **Framework maintenance**: framework-review, post-mortem

### 📁 instructions/
Global guardrails that apply to every session:
- **ALWAYS_DO.md** - Core rules, session hygiene, build/test requirements

---

## Project Conventions

This framework assumes standard paths. If your project differs, update `instructions/PROJECT_PATHS.md`.

See `instructions/PROJECT_PATHS.md` for the full path configuration.

---

## Development Lifecycle

**Note:** Agent labels show primary responsibility. Many steps involve coordination across multiple agents.

### 1. Epic-Level Work (Large Initiatives)

Epic work spans multiple milestones and culminates in a major release:

```
epic-refine (architect)
  ↓
epic-start (architect)
  ↓
[Plan milestones - architect + documenter]
  ↓
[Execute milestones - see Milestone Work below]
  ↓
epic-wrap (documenter + architect + deployer)
  ↓
[PR or direct merge to main]
  ↓
release (deployer) - Epic release ceremony
```

**Epic-wrap involves:**
- Documenter: Archive milestone specs, update roadmaps
- Architect: Verify architecture docs align with implementation
- Deployer: Coordinate merge strategy and release planning

### 2. Milestone-Level Work (Discrete Features)

Individual milestones within an epic (or standalone):

```
milestone-draft (documenter)
  ↓
milestone-start (implementer)
  ↓
red-green-refactor (implementer + tester)
  ↓
code-review (tester)
  ↓
milestone-wrap (documenter)
```

**After milestone-wrap:**
- **If last milestone in epic** → epic-wrap (see Epic Work above)
- **If interim milestone** → Optional tag/deploy, continue to next milestone
- **If standalone milestone** → Optional release ceremony

### 3. Release Strategies

**Milestone Release (interim/optional):**
```
milestone-wrap
  ↓
[Optional: Tag milestone version]
  ↓
[Optional: Deploy to staging/preview]
```

**Epic Release (major):**
```
epic-wrap (all milestones complete)
  ↓
[PR or direct merge to main - architect decides]
  ↓
release (deployer) - Version bump, changelog, tag
  ↓
[Deploy to production]
  ↓
[Notify team]
```

## Key Concepts

### Epics
Large architectural or product themes that span multiple milestones. Examples:
- Add class-based routing to engine
- Implement simulation service with buffer support
- Build UI performance dashboard

### Milestones
Discrete, shippable units of work with clear acceptance criteria. Examples:
- M-02.10: Add provenance query API
- UI-M-03.05: Build timeline visualization
- SIM-M-01.02: Parse YAML templates

### Branches
- **main** - Always green and releasable
- **epic/<slug>** - Integration branch for multi-milestone epics
- **milestone/mX** - Integration branch for multi-surface milestones
- **feature/<surface>-mX/<desc>** - Actual work branches

### Tracking
- **Milestone spec** - Authoritative requirements (stable)
- **Tracking doc** - Implementation progress (dynamic)
- Keep specs stable, update tracking docs frequently

---

## Glossary

**Core Terms:**
- **Epic** - Large architectural or product initiative spanning multiple milestones
- **Milestone** - Discrete, shippable unit of work with clear acceptance criteria
- **AC** - Acceptance Criteria; testable conditions that define milestone completion
- **DoD** - Definition of Done; checklist that must be satisfied before considering work complete
- **TDD** - Test-Driven Development; RED (write failing test) → GREEN (implement) → REFACTOR
- **Spec** - Milestone specification; authoritative requirements document (kept stable)
- **Tracking doc** - Implementation progress log (updated frequently)
- **Session log** - Record of decisions, tool usage, and actions during a work session

**Workflow Terms:**
- **Preflight checks** - Validations run before starting a skill (e.g., epic context exists)
- **Handoff** - Transition from one skill/agent to another with context transfer
- **Gap** - Discovered work not in current milestone scope; triaged for future work
- **Post-mortem** - Reflection on workflow failures to improve framework

**Agent Roles:**
- **Architect** - System design, epic planning, architectural decisions
- **Implementer** - Coding with minimal risk, following TDD
- **Tester** - Test planning, validation, regression safety
- **Documenter** - Documentation quality, release notes
- **Deployer** - Infrastructure, packaging, releases
- **Maintainer** - AI framework evolution (agents/skills), repository infrastructure (NOT solution development)

## Adapting to Your Project

To use this framework in a different project:

1. **Update ALWAYS_DO.md** with your project's conventions
2. **Customize agent responsibilities** for your team structure
3. **Adjust skill references** to match your documentation structure
4. **Modify trigger phrases** for your workflow terminology
5. **Update release skill** for your versioning strategy

---

## Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Always RED → GREEN → REFACTOR:
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve structure with tests still passing

### No Time Estimates
Never include hours, days, or effort estimates in milestone docs. Focus on:
- Clear requirements
- Testable acceptance criteria
- Scope boundaries

### Milestone-First
Work is organized around milestones, not arbitrary sprints or dates:
- Milestones have clear success criteria
- Milestones ship to main when complete
- Next milestone branches from current branch

### Documentation Sync
When milestones or epics complete, documentation must be updated:
- Roadmaps reflect current status
- Architecture docs match reality
- Release notes capture what shipped

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Include time/effort estimates in milestone docs
- Skip writing tests before implementation
- Merge to main without updating documentation
- Use ASCII art diagrams (use Mermaid instead)
- Start coding without a clear milestone spec
- Create branches without checking current branch context

✅ **Do:**
- Write tests first (RED phase)
- Keep milestone specs stable, tracking docs dynamic
- Update roadmaps and docs when milestones complete
- Use Mermaid for diagrams
- Confirm epic context before starting milestones
- Follow conventional commit messages
