# Framework Templates

This folder contains **framework-owned workflow templates** used by the AI assistant to generate framework artifacts (epics, milestones, tracking docs, checklists, etc.).

Guidelines:
- Keep templates generic and reusable across projects.
- Do not place project-specific content here.
- `work/specs/` is separate. It holds **project specifications** (API contracts, schemas, etc.) and is not a template override.

If you change template structure or naming, update any skills or instructions in `.ai/` that reference them.
