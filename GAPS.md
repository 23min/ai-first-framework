# AI-First Framework Gaps

Discovered gaps, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities in the AI-First development framework.

**Scope:** Framework issues, skill gaps, process improvements
**Not included:** Solution/code bugs (use project-level gaps file for those)
**Tracking:** Active gaps are tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/23min/ai-first-framework/issues)

---

## Format

Each framework gap entry should include:
- **Title**: Descriptive heading (no sequential ID to avoid merge conflicts)
- **Discovered**: When and where the gap was found
- **Category**: Skill, Process, Documentation, Tooling, Agent Roles
- **Impact**: Why it matters
- **Status**: Identified, In Progress, Resolved, Won't Fix
- **Recommendation**: Proposed solution

**Note:** We use descriptive titles instead of sequential IDs (FW-GAP-XXX) to prevent merge conflicts when multiple branches add gaps simultaneously. Reference gaps by title in discussions and documentation.

## Workflow

1. Discover a gap during development
2. Log it here as a scratchpad entry (see format above)
3. Promote to a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/23min/ai-first-framework/issues) for tracking
4. Remove the scratchpad entry once the issue is created

## Scratchpad

*New gaps go here before promotion to GitHub Issues.*
